      <p>
      <strong>Hello!</strong> My name is Yoandy (YO-AHN-DEE), and I love the coming together of all things design and technology. 
      I have always gravitated towards tinkering ever since I got my first PC in 1998, but it wasn't until 2017 while working at Apple that I would discover my passion for programming. 
      One day at work, I participated in a Today @ Apple coding educational session â€“ and I <strong>never</strong> looked back. 
      </p>
