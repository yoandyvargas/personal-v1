## My Thoughts 💡

Personal-v1 is my first hands-on experience with Gatsby, and it was a ton of fun to build. The entire project took about 24 hours of building and reading documentation. Additionally, I referenced a few video tutorials for some components – their links are in the component comments.

Notable features:
* Minimalist aesthetic
* Light/dark system preferences by default
* Resume click tracking with plausible analytics
* Work and projects content queried from markdowns using GraphQL

I'm always looking to learn and improve – please feel free to raise PRs and/or provide any feedback you believe would help. Also, feel free to fork if you'd like to use any of the code for your own website (please provide credit) 

Thank you! 🙏🏻
